# Implementing Code Coverage With `-toolexec`

Materials and slides for the talk given at GopherCon 2024.

Source for slides is in [presentation.md](presentation.md).
Rendered slides are in [presentation.pdf](presentation.pdf).

These are frozen to reflect what was used during the talk and will not be
updated, but mistakes are documented below.

Code referenced in the talk is in the following repos:

* [ehden.net/cover](https://ehden.net/cover)
* [ehden.net/fizzbuzz](https://ehden.net/fizzbuzz)

### Mistakes

* tiny closing brace in slides 31-35
* slides 46-47 should have said "update linkter's importcfg" instead of "import linker's importcfg"

### Acknowledgements

* slides were create with Deckset
* visuals/graphs were created with Google Drawings

### Thanks:

* my colleagues at Contrast Security and my team for putting up with my limited throughput while I worked on the talk
* Go team, especially those I met at GopherCon who were kind enough to let me ramble and ask questions at them
